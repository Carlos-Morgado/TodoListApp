| This is a representation of the main view of the app. Here is the tasks list, where you can see all the tasks you’ve created. | This is the view where you can create a new task or edit an existing one. Enter a title, description, and select a priority to organize your tasks. | This menu allows you to sort and filter your tasks by title, date, priority, or completion status, making it easier to find what you need. |
